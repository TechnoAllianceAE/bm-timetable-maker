# Development Summary - October 9, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the development work completed on October 9, 2025, focusing on room management improvements and service monitoring enhancements.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Room Management Enhancement

#### Backend Changes
**Files Modified:**
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` (line 133)
- `backend/src/modules/rooms/dto/create-room.dto.ts`
- `backend/src/modules/rooms/rooms.service.ts` (line 15)

**Changes:**
1. **Added `code` field to Room model**
   - Type: `String?` (optional)
   - Purpose: Store room code/number (e.g., "R101", "LAB-01")
   - Location: backend/prisma/schema.prisma:133

2. **Updated CreateRoomDto**
   - Added `code` field with validation
   - Marked as optional (`@IsOptional()`)
   - Added Swagger documentation

3. **Updated RoomsService**
   - Modified create method to handle `code` field
   - Ensured proper data transformation for Prisma

4. **Database Update**
   - Manually added `code` column to SQLite dev.db
   - Regenerated Prisma client

#### Frontend Changes
**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/app/admin/rooms/page.tsx`

**Simplifications:**
1. **Removed Unnecessary Fields**
   - ❌ Removed: `isLab` (boolean)
   - ❌ Removed: `hasProjector` (boolean)
   - ❌ Removed: `hasAC` (boolean)
   - ❌ Removed: `floor` (number)

2. **Updated Room Interface**
   ```typescript
   interface Room {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     code: string;      // Added
     capacity: number;
     type: string;
     schoolId: string;
     createdAt: string;
   }
   ```

3. **Simplified Form State**
   - Reduced form fields from 8 to 4
   - Cleaner, more focused user experience

4. **Updated Room Display**
   - Show only: name, code, capacity, type
   - Removed: floor number, lab indicator, amenity badges

#### Final Room Fields
- ✅ **name** - Room name (required)
- ✅ **code** - Room code/number (optional)
- ✅ **capacity** - Room capacity (optional)
- ✅ **type** - Room type dropdown (optional)

### 2. Service Management Enhancement

#### Status Script Creation
**Files Created:**
- `STATUS_ALL_SERVICES.sh` (macOS/Linux)
- `STATUS_ALL_SERVICES.bat` (Windows)

**Features:**
1. **Service Detection**
   - Checks if each service is running on its designated port
   - Shows PID (Process ID) for running services
   - Shows process name for identification
   - Color-coded output (Green = Running, Red = Stopped, Yellow = Partial)

2. **Services Monitored**
   - Timetable Engine (Python FastAPI) - Port 8000
   - Backend API (NestJS) - Port 5000
   - Frontend (Next.js) - Port 3000

3. **Status Output**
   - Overall status summary (3/3, 2/3, etc.)
   - Individual service status with details
   - Service URLs for quick access
   - Saved PIDs from .service_pids file
   - Log file locations

4. **Usage**
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   ./STATUS_ALL_SERVICES.sh

   # Windows
   STATUS_ALL_SERVICES.bat
   ```

#### Complete Service Script Suite
Now available:
1. **START_ALL_SERVICES** - Start all services
2. **STOP_ALL_SERVICES** - Stop all services
3. **STATUS_ALL_SERVICES** - Check service status ✨ NEW

All scripts follow consistent patterns and work seamlessly together.

## Git Commits

### Commit: a83c066
**Message:** feat: add code field to Room model

**Files Changed:**
- backend/prisma/schema.prisma
- backend/src/modules/rooms/dto/create-room.dto.ts
- backend/src/modules/rooms/rooms.service.ts

**Description:**
Add optional room code field to simplify room identification and management. Updated CreateRoomDto to accept code field with validation and updated RoomsService to handle code field in room creation.

## Testing Notes

### Room Management
- ✅ Backend builds successfully with new schema
- ✅ Prisma client regenerated correctly
- ✅ Backend running on port 5000
- ⏳ Frontend room creation ready for testing
- ⏳ Room code field persistence needs verification

### Service Scripts
- ✅ STATUS_ALL_SERVICES.sh works correctly
- ✅ Shows all three services (Timetable Engine, Backend, Frontend)
- ✅ Color-coded output displays properly
- ✅ PID and port information accurate
- ✅ Integrates with existing START/STOP scripts

## Known Issues

### Timetable Generation
**Issue:** Timetable generation failing with validation errors

**Errors Observed:**
1. `Object of type GradeSubjectRequirement is not JSON serializable`
   - Python service receiving Prisma model objects instead of plain objects
   - Needs investigation in backend-to-Python data transformation

2. `Record to update not found`
   - Academic year ID `cmg4x4ixh0001ouno5q5d9eb6` doesn't exist
   - User needs to create/select valid academic year

**Note:** These issues are unrelated to the room code field changes made today.

## Database Schema Changes

### Room Model (SQLite)
```sql
-- Added column
ALTER TABLE rooms ADD COLUMN code TEXT;

-- Verification
PRAGMA table_info(rooms);
-- Result: id, schoolId, name, code, capacity, type
```

### Prisma Schema
```prisma
model Room {
  id       String   @id @default(cuid())
  schoolId String
  name     String
  code     String?   // NEW FIELD
  capacity Int?
  type     String?

  school   School   @relation(fields: [schoolId], references: [id])
  classHomeRooms Class[] @relation("ClassHomeRoom")
  timetableEntries TimetableEntry[]

  @@map("rooms")
}
```

## Performance Impact

- ✅ No performance degradation observed
- ✅ Backend rebuild time: Normal (<30 seconds)
- ✅ Prisma client generation: 240ms
- ✅ Room creation API: Expected to maintain current performance

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Test room creation with code field through frontend UI
2. Verify code field persistence in database
3. Test room editing with code field updates

### Future Enhancements
1. Add room code validation (uniqueness per school)
2. Add room code format validation (e.g., regex patterns)
3. Consider making code field required instead of optional
4. Add room code to CSV import functionality

## Documentation Updates Required

### Files to Update
- ✅ DEVELOPMENT_SUMMARY_OCT9.md (this file)
- ✅ CLAUDE.md - Added room code field info and service script commands
- ✅ README.md - Updated Quick Start with service scripts and service URLs
- ✅ PRD - Updated room entity specification, added October 9 updates section, bumped to v2.6
- ✅ SERVICE_SCRIPTS.md - Added STATUS_ALL_SERVICES documentation with example output
