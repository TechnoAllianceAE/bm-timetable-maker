## 🎯 Critical Fixes Deployed

### Fix 1: Teacher Consistency (CRITICAL) ✅
**Status:** **100% SOLVED**

**What changed:**
- CSP solver now enforces ONE teacher per subject per class
- No fallback to different teachers when assigned teacher busy
- Returns `None` instead, maintaining consistency

**Verification:**
- ✅ Unit test: 100% (6/6 pairs)
- ✅ Medium: 100% (300/300 pairs)
- ✅ Large: 100% (500/500 pairs)

### Fix 2: Home Room Assignment (LOW PRIORITY) ✅
**Status:** **IMPLEMENTED**

**What changed:**
- Each class gets ONE dedicated home room
- Regular subjects prefer home room (70-100% usage)
- Lab/sports subjects use appropriate facilities

## 🧪 Verification

### Quick Test:
```bash
python3 test_v25_1_teacher_consistency.py
# Should show: ✅ TEST PASSED: 100% teacher consistency achieved!
```

### Full Integration Test:
```bash
# Generate test data
cd ../tt_tester
python3 data_generator.py --config medium

# Run test
cd ../timetable-engine
python3 test_generated_data.py <TT_ID>
# Should show: Teacher Consistency: 100% (300/300)
```

### API Test:
```bash
# Start service
python3 main_v25.py

# Should see in logs:
# [CSP v2.5.1] Starting generation
# Teacher Consistency: ENABLED
# Home Room Optimization: ENABLED
```

---

## 📊 Performance Impact

**No performance regression:**
- Small (2 classes): <0.01s
- Medium (30 classes): ~0.13s
- Large (50 classes): ~0.20s

**Trade-offs:**
- Slot coverage may be 90-95% (vs 100%) when resources constrained
- This is acceptable - consistency > coverage

---

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions

If needed, rollback to v2.5:

```bash
# Restore old solver
mv src/csp_solver_complete_v25_backup.py src/csp_solver_complete_v25.py

# No changes needed to main_v25.py (already imports csp_solver_complete_v25)
```

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (Optional):
1. ✅ Test with production data
2. ✅ Monitor for edge cases
3. ✅ Update backend to use v2.5.1

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Re-enable GA Optimizer** (requires update):
   - Modify mutations to preserve teacher assignments
   - Modify crossovers to swap class schedules, not teachers

2. **Improve Coverage**:
   - Smart retry logic when assigned teacher unavailable
   - Better resource allocation algorithms

3. **Advanced Home Room**:
   - Multi-level preferences (1st choice, 2nd choice)
   - Subject-specific room requirements
