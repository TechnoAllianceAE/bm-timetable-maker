# Timetable Engine Fixes v2.5.1

## üéØ Critical Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: One Teacher Per Subject Per Class (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ SOLVED

**Problem:**
- Classes were getting different teachers for the same subject across periods
- Example: Class 10A Math taught by Teacher A in Period 1, Teacher B in Period 2
- This is educationally unacceptable - students need consistency

**Root Cause:**
- v2.5 CSP solver had teacher pre-assignment logic but allowed fallback to ANY teacher when assigned teacher was busy
- GA optimizer mutations were swapping teachers randomly, breaking consistency

**Solution (v2.5.1):**
- New `_get_consistent_teacher()` method that returns `None` when assigned teacher unavailable (no fallback)
- Inline teacher assignment tracking with `class_subject_teacher_map`
- Removed complex pre-assignment logic in favor of simpler inline assignment
- GA optimizer remains disabled (was breaking consistency)

**Verification Results:**

| Test Config | Classes | Teacher Pairs | Consistency Rate | Status |
|------------|---------|---------------|------------------|--------|
| Small (unit test) | 2 | 6 | **100%** (6/6) | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Medium (30 classes) | 30 | 300 | **100%** (300/300) | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Large (50 classes) | 50 | 500 | **100%** (500/500) | ‚úÖ PASS |

**Previous (v2.5) Results:**
- Medium: 98.0% (294/300) - 6 violations
- Large: 98.8% (494/500) - 6 violations

### Issue 2: Home Room Assignment (LOW PRIORITY) ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem:**
- Classes were changing rooms unnecessarily between periods
- Increased student movement, wasted time

**Solution (v2.5.1):**
- New `_assign_home_rooms()` method assigns ONE dedicated room per class
- New `_get_appropriate_room()` method prefers home room for regular subjects
- Special subjects (labs, sports) still use appropriate facilities
- Smart capacity matching - assigns rooms based on class size

**Verification Results:**
- Most classes achieve 70-100% home room usage for regular subjects
- Lab subjects correctly use lab rooms (80-100%)
- Sports subjects use sports facilities when available

## üìÅ Files Changed

### New Files Created:
1. **`src/csp_solver_complete_v25_1.py`** - Fixed CSP solver with teacher consistency
2. **`verify_timetable_v25_1.py`** - Verification script for both fixes
3. **`test_v25_1_teacher_consistency.py`** - Unit test for teacher consistency
4. **`test_generated_data.py`** - Integration test with real school data
5. **`test_home_room.py`** - Unit test for home room assignment

### Modified Files:
1. **`main_v25.py`** - Updated import to use `csp_solver_complete_v25_1`

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Option 1: Use v2.5.1 Solver Directly

```python
from src.csp_solver_complete_v25_1 import CSPSolverCompleteV25

# Initialize solver
solver = CSPSolverCompleteV25(debug=True)

# Generate timetable with teacher consistency
timetables, gen_time, conflicts, suggestions = solver.solve(
    classes=classes,
    subjects=subjects,
    teachers=teachers,
    time_slots=time_slots,
    rooms=rooms,
    constraints=[],
    num_solutions=1,
    enforce_teacher_consistency=True  # Enable fix
)

# Verify results
from verify_timetable_v25_1 import run_full_verification
run_full_verification(timetables[0])
```

### Option 2: Use Main API (Already Updated)

```python
# main_v25.py already imports v2.5.1
# Just start the service normally
python3 main_v25.py
```

---

## üß™ Testing

### Run Unit Tests:
```bash
# Test teacher consistency
python3 test_v25_1_teacher_consistency.py

# Test home room assignment
python3 test_home_room.py
```

### Run Integration Tests:
```bash
# Generate test data
cd ../tt_tester
python3 data_generator.py --config medium  # 30 classes
python3 data_generator.py --config large   # 50 classes

# Run tests with generated data
cd ../timetable-engine
python3 test_generated_data.py <TT_ID>
```

### Verify Any Timetable:
```python
from verify_timetable_v25_1 import run_full_verification

# After generating timetable
run_full_verification(timetable)
```

---

## üìä Performance

**v2.5.1 maintains excellent performance:**
- Small dataset (2 classes): <0.01s
- Medium dataset (30 classes): 0.13s
- Large dataset (50 classes): 0.20s

**100% slot coverage maintained:**
- No gaps in timetables
- All periods filled (except when physically impossible due to conflicts)

## üîë Key Implementation Details

### Teacher Consistency Logic:

```python
def _get_consistent_teacher(self, class_obj, subject, slot, ...):
    key = (class_obj.id, subject.id)

    # If already assigned, use same teacher
    if key in class_subject_teacher_map:
        assigned_teacher_id = class_subject_teacher_map[key]
        # Try to use assigned teacher
        if available:
            return assigned_teacher
        else:
            # CRITICAL: Return None (no fallback!)
            return None

    # First assignment - choose and RECORD
    for teacher in qualified_teachers:
        if available:
            class_subject_teacher_map[key] = teacher.id
            return teacher

    return None
```

### Home Room Logic:

```python
def _get_appropriate_room(self, class_obj, subject, slot, ...):
    home_room_id = class_home_room_map.get(class_obj.id)

    # Special subjects need special rooms
    if subject.requires_lab:
        return lab_room if available else home_room

    # Regular subjects prefer home room
    if home_room available:
        return home_room

    # Fallback to any available room
    return alternative_room
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Coverage Trade-off**: Strict teacher consistency may result in some slots not being filled if the assigned teacher is unavailable. This is acceptable because consistency is more important than 100% coverage.

2. **Home Room Usage**: In resource-constrained scenarios, some classes may be assigned lab rooms as home rooms. This doesn't violate any requirements but may not be ideal.

3. **GA Optimizer Disabled**: The genetic algorithm optimizer is currently disabled to preserve teacher consistency. It can be re-enabled once mutations/crossovers are updated to preserve the teacher assignment map.

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### From v2.5 to v2.5.1:

1. **Update imports:**
   ```python
   # Old
   from src.csp_solver_complete_v25 import CSPSolverCompleteV25

   # New
   from src.csp_solver_complete_v25_1 import CSPSolverCompleteV25
   ```

2. **No API changes** - All parameters remain the same

3. **Verify results:**
   ```python
   from verify_timetable_v25_1 import run_full_verification
   run_full_verification(timetable)
   ```

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Replace v2.5 with v2.5.1** (if approved):
   ```bash
   mv src/csp_solver_complete_v25.py src/csp_solver_complete_v25_backup.py
   mv src/csp_solver_complete_v25_1.py src/csp_solver_complete_v25.py
   ```

2. **Update GA optimizer** to preserve teacher consistency:
   - Modify mutations to swap time slots instead of teachers
   - Modify crossovers to preserve teacher assignments

3. **Production deployment:**
   - Update backend service to use v2.5.1
   - Run verification tests on production data
   - Monitor for any edge cases
