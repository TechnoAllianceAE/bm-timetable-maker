Genetic Algorithm Optimizer for Timetable Optimization

VERSION 2.5 - Metadata-Driven Optimization

CHANGELOG v2.5:
- Replaced hardcoded subject keywords with subject_metadata.prefer_morning
- Replaced hardcoded period cutoff (4) with weights.morning_period_cutoff
- Replaced hardcoded max_consecutive (3) with teacher_metadata.max_consecutive_periods
- All business logic now configurable via metadata
- Language-agnostic (works with any language)
- School-customizable (different structures supported)

BENEFITS v2.5:
- Zero hardcoded subject names (works in English, Spanish, Hindi, etc.)
- Zero hardcoded time assumptions (supports 6, 8, or 10-period days)
- Zero hardcoded teacher limits (per-teacher customization)
- Professional, scalable architecture

COMPATIBILITY:
- Requires models_phase1_v25.py (OptimizationWeights with new fields)
- Requires csp_solver_complete_v25.py (TimetableEntry with metadata)
- Backward compatible (graceful degradation if metadata missing)

        Fitness Calculation Strategy:
        ------------------------------
        Start with base score of 1000 and subtract penalties for violations.
        Each penalty type has a weight that controls how much we care about it.
        
        Penalty Types:
        1. Workload imbalance - Teachers have unequal teaching loads
        2. Student gaps - Empty periods between classes in a day
        3. Time preferences - Subjects scheduled at wrong times (METADATA-DRIVEN)
        4. Consecutive periods - Teachers teaching too many periods in a row (METADATA-DRIVEN)
        
        All weights are configurable via OptimizationWeights in the API request.

        Metadata-Driven Approach:
        -------------------------
        Uses subject metadata (prefer_morning flag) instead of hardcoded keywords.
        This makes the system:
        - Language-agnostic (works with any language)
        - School-customizable (each school defines their preferences)
        - Maintainable (no code changes needed for curriculum updates)
        
        How It Works:
        1. Reads subject_metadata.prefer_morning from each assignment
        2. Reads weights.morning_period_cutoff to define "morning"
        3. Penalizes if prefer_morning=True but period > cutoff
        
        Fallback Behavior:
        - If subject metadata not available, no penalty applied
        - If morning_period_cutoff not set, uses default of 4
        - System continues to work even without metadata
        
        Examples:
        - Math (prefer_morning=True) at period 2, cutoff=4 → no penalty
        - Math (prefer_morning=True) at period 7, cutoff=4 → penalty!

        VERSION 2.5: METADATA-DRIVEN (replaces hardcoded max_consecutive = 3)
        
        Metadata-Driven Approach:
        -------------------------
        Uses teacher metadata (max_consecutive_periods) instead of hardcoded value.
        This allows per-teacher customization based on:
        - Teacher preference/contract
        - Subject intensity (Lab teachers vs. regular teachers)
        - Teacher experience level
        - Union rules or school policy
        
        Educational Rationale:
        ----------------------
        Teaching is cognitively demanding. Research suggests that teaching quality
        degrades after 3 consecutive periods without a break. However, this varies:
        - Experienced teachers may handle 4-5 consecutive periods
        - Lab/Workshop teachers often need more breaks (equipment setup)
        - Part-time teachers may prefer longer consecutive blocks
        
        How It Works:
        1. Reads teacher_metadata.max_consecutive_periods for each teacher
        2. Groups assignments by day per teacher
        3. Counts consecutive runs of periods
        4. Penalizes runs that exceed teacher's specific limit
        
        Fallback Behavior:
        - If teacher metadata not available, uses default of 3
        - System continues to work even without metadata
        
        Examples:
        - Teacher A (max=3): [P1,P2,P3,P4] → penalty of 1 (4 > 3)
        - Teacher B (max=4): [P1,P2,P3,P4] → no penalty (4 ≤ 4)
        - Teacher C (max=2): [P1,P2,P3] → penalty of 1 (3 > 2)

        Crossover Strategy - Swapping Assignment Blocks:
        -------------------------------------------------
        Instead of randomly mixing individual assignments (which would likely
        create conflicts), we swap entire blocks of assignments between parents.
        This preserves local consistency while still introducing variation.
        
        Trade-offs of This Approach:
        1. PRO: Less likely to break hard constraints than random mixing
        2. PRO: Faster than validating every possible swap
        3. CON: May still introduce conflicts (teacher double-booked)
        4. CON: Limited exploration of solution space
        
        Why We Accept the Trade-off:
        - The fitness function will penalize any conflicts that arise
        - Natural selection will eliminate invalid offspring over generations
        - The alternative (exhaustive validation) is too slow for real-time API
        - Elitism ensures we never lose our best valid solutions
        
        Alternative Approaches Considered:
        - Full constraint validation after crossover (too slow)
        - Only swap assignments with no shared resources (too restrictive)
        - Repair invalid offspring (complex, may introduce new issues)
        
        Current approach balances speed, simplicity, and effectiveness.

        Mutation Strategy - Teacher Assignment Swaps:
        ----------------------------------------------
        Rather than mutating time slots or rooms (which would cascade into
        many conflicts), we swap teacher assignments between two entries.
        This is the safest type of mutation for timetable problems.
        
        Why Swap Teachers Instead of Times/Rooms:
        1. Time slot changes affect the entire schedule structure
        2. Room changes require capacity/facility constraint re-checking
        3. Teacher swaps are more localized and easier to validate
        4. Most timetable flexibility comes from teacher assignments
        
        Trade-offs of This Approach:
        1. PRO: Minimal chance of creating cascading conflicts
        2. PRO: Fast execution (no complex validation needed)
        3. PRO: Preserves the time structure found by CSP solver
        4. CON: May create teacher double-booking (same teacher, same time)
        5. CON: Limited mutation space (only swaps, no new assignments)
        
        Why We Accept the Trade-off:
        - Teacher conflicts are detected quickly in fitness calculation
        - Natural selection eliminates invalid mutants within a few generations
        - The alternative (validating every constraint) is prohibitively slow
        - CSP already found valid time/room assignments - we want to keep those
        
        Validation Strategy:
        - We DON'T validate here (performance > perfect accuracy)
        - Instead, fitness function assigns low scores to conflicts
        - Elitism ensures we never lose working solutions
        - Over generations, valid mutations survive and spread
        
        Future Enhancement (if needed):
        - Could add lightweight teacher availability check
        - Could swap only between compatible subjects
        - Could implement repair mechanism for conflicts
        Currently, the simple approach works well enough for real-world use.
