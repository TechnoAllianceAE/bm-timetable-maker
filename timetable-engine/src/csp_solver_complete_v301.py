"""
Complete CSP Solver v3.0.1 - Simplified Room Allocation + Performance Optimizations

VERSION 3.0.1 - Performance Optimized
Release Date: October 2025
Based on v3.0 with performance improvements

KEY IMPROVEMENTS FROM v2.5:
============================
1. SIMPLIFIED ROOM LOGIC:
   - Home classrooms are pre-assigned (from database)
   - Only schedules shared amenities (labs, sports, art, music, library)
   - 2-level room allocation instead of 5-level fallback
   - 85% reduction in room conflict checks

2. PERFORMANCE:
   - Before: Track 40+ classrooms × 35 slots = 1,400 checks
   - After: Track 6-10 shared rooms × 35 slots = 210 checks
   - Result: 85% faster room allocation

3. CODE QUALITY:
   - Reduced from ~50 lines to ~25 lines for room logic
   - Clearer error messages
   - Easier to test and maintain

ALGORITHM:
==========
Phase 1: Greedy teacher pre-assignment (unchanged from v2.5.2)
Phase 2: CSP scheduling with simplified room allocation
  - Regular subjects → Use pre-assigned home classroom (NO conflict check)
  - Special subjects → Allocate from shared amenities pool (WITH conflict check)

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:
=======================
- Maintains all v2.5 features:
  * Teacher consistency (one teacher per subject per class)
  * Grade-specific subject requirements
  * Metadata-driven optimization
  * 100% slot coverage guarantee

    KEY FEATURES:
    1. Greedy teacher pre-assignment (from v2.5.2)
    2. One teacher per subject per class (from v2.5.2)
    3. SIMPLIFIED ROOM ALLOCATION (from v3.0):
       - Home classrooms pre-assigned in database
       - Only shared amenities need scheduling
       - 2-level allocation logic (home OR shared)
    4. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS (new in v3.0.1):
       - Cached lookups for hot paths
       - Pre-computed subject metadata
       - Optimized teacher search with dict-based indexing
       - Reduced redundant calculations
       - Early termination in loops
