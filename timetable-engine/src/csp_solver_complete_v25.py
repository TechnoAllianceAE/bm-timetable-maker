Complete CSP Solver - Ensures NO GAPS in timetable
Every slot must be filled for every class

VERSION 2.5.1 - Teacher Consistency & Home Room Optimization

CHANGELOG v2.5.1:
- FIX 1 (CRITICAL): One teacher per subject per class throughout academic year
- FIX 2 (LOW PRIORITY): Home room assignment for each class
- Maintains all v2.5 metadata-driven features

CRITICAL FIX:
Previously: Math Period 1 = Teacher A, Math Period 2 = Teacher B (WRONG!)
Now: Math Period 1 = Teacher A, Math Period 2 = Teacher A, Math Period 3 = Teacher A (CORRECT!)

COMPATIBILITY:
- Works with models_phase1_v25.py
- Backward compatible (metadata defaults to None if not available)
