"""
Phase 1 Models - VERSION 3.0

VERSION 3.0 - Simplified Room Allocation
Release Date: October 2025

MAJOR CHANGES FROM v2.5:
========================
1. SIMPLIFIED ROOM ALLOCATION:
   - Home classrooms are PRE-ASSIGNED in database (one-time setup)
   - Timetable engine ONLY schedules shared amenities (labs, art, music, sports, library)
   - Regular subjects automatically use pre-assigned home classroom
   - No dynamic home room assignment during timetable generation

2. NEW CONCEPTS:
   - SharedRoom: Represents amenities that need scheduling (labs, sports, art, etc.)
   - home_room_id in Class model is MANDATORY (must be pre-configured)

3. REMOVED COMPLEXITY:
   - No more dynamic home room assignment
   - No more 5-level room fallback logic
   - No home classroom conflict tracking (they're never shared)
   - 85% reduction in room conflict checks

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:
======================
- Maintains all v2.5 metadata-driven optimization features
- Teacher consistency enforcement (one teacher per subject per class)
- Grade-specific subject requirements
- Subject time preferences (prefer_morning, etc.)

MIGRATION FROM v2.5:
===================
- Requires home classrooms to be assigned to all classes in database
- Backend validation ensures homeRoomId is set before timetable generation
- Shared rooms are filtered from room list (type: LAB, SPORTS, LIBRARY, AUDITORIUM)
