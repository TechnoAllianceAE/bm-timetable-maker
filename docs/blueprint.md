- Background color: Light gray (#E0E0E0) for a neutral backdrop that reduces eye strain during long sessions.
- Accent color: Yellow-Orange (#FFA500) for interactive elements, providing an optimistic contrast and drawing attention to areas needing action or decisions.
- Body text font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clear and accessible readability, providing clarity and neutrality across various screen sizes.

- A uniform set of flat design icons colored white, to pop out over the primary colored backdrop in buttons or side navigation.
