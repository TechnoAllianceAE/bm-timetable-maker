# Code Audit Report - School Timetable Management System

## Executive Summary
**Critical Finding**: The system is NOT ready for production. Major components claimed as "complete" are either missing or partially implemented.

## Module-by-Module Audit Results

### 1. Python Timetable Engine (/timetable-engine)
**Status**: PARTIALLY COMPLETE (60%)
- ✅ Files exist: main.py, csp_solver.py, ga_optimizer.py, wellness_calculator.py, models.py, errors.py
- ✅ FastAPI endpoints defined (/generate, /validate)
- ✅ CSP solver has basic structure with OR-Tools
- ⚠️ CSP solver references undefined `RoomType` (line 145 in csp_solver.py)
- ⚠️ No actual test implementation (tests exist but need verification)
- ⚠️ Wellness calculator present but tightly coupled (should be removed for Phase 1)

### 2. Backend Node.js API (/backend)
**Status**: CRITICALLY INCOMPLETE (30%)

#### Auth Module (src/auth/)
- ✅ auth.service.ts: Complete with register/login/verify functions
- ✅ auth.routes.ts: Basic routes implemented
- ✅ JWT token generation and bcrypt password hashing
- ⚠️ No refresh token mechanism
- ⚠️ No password reset functionality

#### User Management (src/users/)
- ✅ user.service.ts: CRUD operations implemented
- ✅ user.routes.ts: All routes defined with authentication middleware
- ✅ RBAC checks for admin/principal roles
- ❌ **NOT REGISTERED in app.ts** - Routes are not connected!

#### Timetable Routes
- ❌ **COMPLETELY MISSING** - No timetable routes or services exist
- ❌ No integration with Python microservice
- ❌ No CRUD operations for timetables
- ❌ No endpoints to call Python /generate endpoint

#### App Configuration (src/app.ts)
- ✅ Express setup with middleware
- ✅ CORS, Helmet, Rate limiting configured
- ❌ **ONLY /auth routes registered** - Missing /users, /timetables, etc.
- ❌ No connection to Python service configured

### 3. Frontend (/frontend)
**Status**: MINIMAL IMPLEMENTATION (15%)
- ✅ Basic Next.js setup with React 19 RC
- ✅ Homepage with UI mockup (page.tsx)
- ✅ Login page exists (auth/login/page.tsx)
- ❌ No registration page
- ❌ No admin pages (referenced but don't exist)
- ❌ No teacher dashboard
- ❌ No timetable UI
- ❌ No API service layer
- ❌ Using hardcoded localhost:3000 for API calls

### 4. Database
**Status**: SCHEMA ONLY (20%)
- ✅ Prisma schema defined with all entities
- ❌ **NO MIGRATIONS** - Database never initialized
- ❌ No seed data despite seed.ts mentioned
- ❌ Wellness entities defined but should be removed for Phase 1

### 5. Wellness Module (/backend/src/wellness)
**Status**: STUB FILES ONLY (5%)
- ✅ Directory structure created
- ❌ All files appear to be empty stubs or minimal implementations
- ❓ Should be removed entirely per your Phase 1 focus

## Critical Issues Found

1. **Backend is non-functional**: User routes not registered, no timetable functionality
2. **No database**: Migrations never run, database doesn't exist
3. **No API integration**: Backend doesn't connect to Python service
4. **Frontend barely started**: Only 2 pages exist out of dozens needed
5. **Misleading WIP.md**: Claims many features complete that don't exist

## Immediate Actions Required

### Phase 1 - Make Core Timetable Work
1. **Fix Backend Routes**:
   - Register user routes in app.ts
   - Create timetable service and routes
   - Add Python service integration

2. **Initialize Database**:
   - Run `prisma migrate dev` to create database
   - Create seed data for testing

3. **Remove Wellness Code**:
   - Delete wellness directory from backend
   - Remove wellness fields from Prisma schema
   - Remove wellness logic from Python service

4. **Complete Core API**:
   - Implement /timetables CRUD endpoints
   - Add /timetables/:id/generate endpoint
   - Test Python service integration

5. **Basic Frontend**:
   - Create registration page
   - Build simple timetable view page
   - Add basic admin panel for creating timetables

## Revised Completion Estimate
- **Currently Complete**: ~25% of Phase 1
- **Backend Core**: 2-3 days to implement missing pieces
- **Database Setup**: 1 day
- **Frontend Basic UI**: 3-4 days
- **Integration Testing**: 2 days
- **Total to MVP**: 8-10 days of focused development

## Recommendation
The codebase is far from the "complete" status claimed in WIP.md. Focus on getting a basic timetable generation working end-to-end before adding any wellness features. The current code provides a foundation but requires significant work to be functional.
